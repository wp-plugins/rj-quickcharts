Build Complex, Powerful HTML5 Charts in Just Minutes.

RJ Quick Charts is the only WordPress plugin available that allows users to easily enter data that is immediately built out into a chart below as they type. Quick Charts uses all native WordPress UI so it feels right at home without adding any excessive bloat to your site.

Build and publish your chart in minutes by:

The chart will be dynamically built out and updated as you type. Once youâ€™re done, just save it and add it to any Post, Page or Custom Post Type by going to Add Media -> Insert Quick Chart.
